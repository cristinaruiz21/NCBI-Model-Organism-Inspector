Taxonomy Entrez supports Boolean queries that includes search fields common across all Entrez databases. This is a uniform indexing, search, and retrieval engine for names. It differs from the other Entrez databases in that the default search field is [all names] instead of [all terms] – unless you specify an explicit search field, Taxonomy Entrez assumes that you are searching with a name (or a TaxId). Each entry in the Taxonomy Entrez results represents a taxon and is identified by its primary name. The primary name for a taxon may be either formal (e.g. Homo sapiens) or informal (e.g. Homo sp. Altai, or uncultured fungus). Taxa above the species level may also be either formal (e.g. the order Mammalia) or informal (e.g. the clade node eudicotyledons). In addition, each taxon may be associated with secondary names with several relational terms – homotypic synonyms, basionyms, misspellings, common names and so on.
